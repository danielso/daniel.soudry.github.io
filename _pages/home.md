Welcome to my home page !

I am an associate professor and Schmidt Career Advancement Chair in AI, working in the [Deparment of Electrical & Copmuter Engineering ](https://ece.technion.ac.il/) at the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), in the area of machine learning. I am especially interested in all aspects of neural networks and deep learning (see [Research](research)). 

 **Motivation**

I am interested in a quantitative understanding of intelligence, both artificial and biological — and in the possible relationship between the two. I am mainly focused on neural network models, which are a canonical model for neural computation in the brain and are a central part of many modern artificial intelligence systems. 

Such [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) with deep architectures have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many other domains. 

Despite this impressive progress, artificial neural networks are still [far behind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) the capabilities of [biological neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuit) in most areas: even the simplest fly is far more resourceful than our most advanced robots. This indicates we have much to improve! 

At the same time, if we wish to understand biological neural networks we must first be able to understand learning in the simplest non-linear artificial neural network – which still remains a mystery.

Therefore, my current research aims to uncover the fundamental mathematical principles governing both types of neural networks.

Short Bio

I did my post-doc (as a [Gruss Lipper](https://eglcf.org/) fellow) working with Prof. [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.columbia.edu/) and the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/).

I did my Ph.D. (2008-2013, direct track) in the Network Biology Research Laboratory in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Prof. [Ron Meir](https://ronmeir.net.technion.ac.il/).

In 2008 I graduated summa cum laude with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and a B.Sc. in Physics, after studying in the Technion since 2004.

 **I am looking for highly motivated and excellent MSc/PhD students and Post-Docs with similar research interests to join our team!** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team)
